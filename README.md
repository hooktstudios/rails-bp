# Rails Boilerplate

Collections of gems / code we tend to use on about every project.
Feel free to take whatever you need.

**Work in progress. Not much to see for now.**

## I'm in a hurry, get me started

**INCOMPLETE** (Yup, Backstreet Boys song)

Change the \_\_YOUR\_PROJECT\_NAME\_\_ in the third line

    git clone git://github.com/hooktstudios/rails-bp.git
    cd rails-bp
    perl -e "s/RailsBP/__YOUR_PROJECT_NAME__/g;" -pi $(find . -name "*.rb" -o -name "Rakefile" -o -name "*.erb" -o -name "*.ru")
    git submodule update --init
    cp config/capistrano-recipes/config-samples/unicorn.rb config/unicorn.rb
    curl http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/assets/css/bootstrap.css > vendor/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap.css

**Edit config/deploy.rb, config/database.yml and config/unicorn.rb**

## Intended usage
This is intended to be used as a collection of tools to start projects quickly.
This is by no mean a perfect solution and it definitey has to be customized.

**Do not use this if you don't understand what's going on under the hood.**

### Admin
Let's stop re-inventing the wheel for admin backends. The boilerplate includes
an helper to create admin forms which defaults to the Twitter Bootstrap SimpleForm
wraper, and an admin base controller.

Don't want no admin? Remove ALL THE FILES:

    rm -rf app/helpers/admin app/controllers/admin app/views/layouts/admin.html.erb app/assets/stylesheets/admin.css

## Credits

Credits goes to all the gems contributors. Bootstrap integration is stolen from [SimpleFormBootstrap](https://github.com/rafaelfranca/simple_form-bootstrap)

## TODOs
* Move most of this stuff to generators
* Create a CLI tool that helps setuping the boilerplate instead of copying commands
* Write generators for more Twitter Bootstrap admin goodness
